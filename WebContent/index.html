<h1>Tuxconfig</h1>
</div>
    A client /server system to make installing Linux kernel modules easier. The server (written in Java) allows<br>
    developers to contribute kernel configuration modules using their GitHub account. <br>
    The client program installs these kernel modules using a graphical interface (written in C++) removing the need for a user<br>
    to use the terminal.  This solution could overcome a major obstacle of Linux adoption, by configuring new<br>
    devices in an easy to use manor.  It is a proof of concept and not a final product. I believe with time i can<br>
    make this production ready.

    This was my dissertation for my degree at Kent University.  The text is <a href="dissertation.pdf" download>here </a><br>
    I am happy to continue it's development, not only for Ubuntu linux but all distributions.<br>
    What I need: As at it's core this application this system inserts binary code into the Kernel, the system<br>
    would need a team to vet each configuration submitted, ensuring that the Makefiles are not malicious and <br>
    that binary drivers are from a legitimate source.
