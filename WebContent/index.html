This is a platform and application to facilitate the installation of devices for the Ubuntu linux distribution.
Developers can sign in with their GitHub.com account to submit repositories to make a range of devices work
on a client platform.   
Each code submission is checked to ensure that it will not damage the host system.

The client downloads the package below in order to install devices where a configuration has been submitted.
A backup of the state of the module configuration is made, which will restore the system  
to it's previous state, in situations where an installation fails.
